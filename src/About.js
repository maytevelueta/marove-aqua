            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "120%" }}>I'm Mayté from México, and I'm a watercolor enthusiast. Marove Aqua started two years ago as a little personal side project to decorate my appartment. Before that, I had never painted with watercolors, and the experience was a game changer to me.</p>
            <br/>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "120%" }}>My paints are focused on hyperrealism still lifes, all made with Winsor and Newton pigments over cold pressed paper. I keep practicing and improving my techniques. If you have any suggestions or want to order a customize painting, please contact me and I'll be happy to reach you.</p>
